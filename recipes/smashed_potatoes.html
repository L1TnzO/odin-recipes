    <p>Sea salt gives these baby reds a delightfully crispy crust with creamy smooth smashed-potato centers. Fresh rosemary lends a fragrant herbal note. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 baby red potatoes, scrubbed, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons sea salt, divided</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh rosemary, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Pour 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil onto the parchment paper-covered sheet. Place potatoes on the oil and roll to coat. Push potatoes to one side of the pan. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon sea salt onto oil; space potatoes evenly on the salted oil.</li>
        <li>Place the bottom of a drinking glass on each potato and push down firmly until the it cracks open and is about 1-inch thick. Brush potatoes with remaining oil and sprinkle with remaining sea salt. Sprinkle with pepper to taste. Tuck rosemary sprigs among potatoes.</li>
